        <h2>One Small Step for Man, One Giant Leap for Mankind </h2>
        <p>
          The Apollo 11 mission launched from Cape Kennedy on July 16, 1969, with the primary objective of fulfilling President John F. Kennedy’s goal of landing a crew on the moon and returning them safely to Earth. Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin crewed the mission. On July 20, 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon, a moment witnessed by an estimated 650 million television viewers around the world. Upon setting foot on the lunar surface, he uttered the now-iconic phrase, “…one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”

      <p class="section-text">Neil Armstrong's A-7L lunar spacesuit was essentially a form-fitting spacecraft, providing him with breathable air and protection from extreme temperatures, radiation, and micrometeoroids during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. It was designed to permit maximum mobility and comfort for up to 115 hours when worn in conjunction with the liquid cooling garment. The spacesuit, transferred to the National Air and Space Museum in 1971, was constructed in the Extra-vehicular (EV) configuration and is now on display as part of the "Destination Moon" exhibit.

      <p class="section-text">The Apollo 11 Command Module, named "Columbia," was one of three parts of the Apollo 11 spacecraft and was manufactured by North American Rockwell. The Command Module, which was the only part of the spacecraft to return to Earth, carried astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, and Michael Collins to the moon and back during the first lunar landing mission in July 1969. It separated from the Service Module before re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.  After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the Command Module was transferred to the Smithsonian in 1971 after a NASA-sponsored tour of American cities. 

      You can visit the Command Module on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

         The gloves were made for use outside of the spacecraft and were worn by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission in July of 1969. 
         The gloves were transferred from NASA to the National Air and Space Museum in 1971.
         The fingertips of the gloves were made of silicone rubber to provide sensitivity.
        
        The outer shell of the gloves were made of Chromel-R fabric and was designed to protect the astronaut from extreme temperatures. The inner part of the glove was made from a rubber/neoprene compound. They attached to the spacesuit in the same way that the gloves designed for use inside the spacecraft did.
